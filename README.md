## Usage

Users can right-click to open the context menu, where they can select from a variety of nodes to add to the canvas. Users can also press `Shift` + `A` to open the menu. Node blocks can also be added via a variety of hotkeys. For example:

 - **Input Nodes** can be added with `Shift` + `R`. 
 - **Function Nodes** can be added with `Shift` + `F`.
 - **Output Nodes** can be added with `Shift` + `C`.
 - **Variable Nodes** can be added with `Shift` + `V`.

 When connecting nodes together, a variable node and output node are necessary. To cycle between different operations in the function node blocks, simply click the operation name. To delete a node block, you can simply select the desired node block to delete and use any of the following hotkeys:

  - **Regular Delete** can be done with `Backspace` or `Delete`
  - **Blender Delete** can be done with `x`
  - **(Neo)Vi(m) Delete** can be done with `d`

To pan around the editor or grapher, simply use the mouse wheel or hold shift and drag.
